# Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition ðŸŽ­

This project aims to provide real-time facial expression recognition using a combination of TensorFlow's image generator, transfer learning with fine-tuning techniques, and OpenCV for real-time image processing.

# Overview ðŸŒŸ
Facial expression recognition plays a significant role in various fields such as human-computer interaction, emotion analysis, and psychology. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize facial expressions in real-time, enabling applications in areas like emotion-aware computing, virtual reality, and augmented reality.

# Features ðŸš€
**Real-Time Recognition** : Utilize the power of OpenCV for real-time facial expression recognition.
**Image Generator** : TensorFlow's image generator is employed to preprocess and augment the facial expression dataset for improved model training.
**Transfer Learning with Fine-Tuning** : Transfer learning techniques are applied, leveraging pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet, fine-tuning them on the facial expression dataset for improved performance.
